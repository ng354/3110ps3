Summarize your solution
-----------------------

* What was your approach to solving the assignment?
We began this assignment by understanding it completely and implementing
crawl. Once we understood the concepts, and how pages were mapped to words and
other sets of links, we broke it down and efficiently implemented it using
various data structures (2-3 trees).


* Are there any known bugs in your solution?
Nope!
